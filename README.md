Script for marking [Stat 929 (Theoretical) Time series](https://uwflow.com/course/stat929) and [Stat 443 Forecasting](https://uwflow.com/course/stat443) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)

Instructor: Prof. [Gregory Rice](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/greg-rice)

TA: Chi-Kuang Yeh

# Description
Each script corresponds to one scenario in the forecasting competition.

Utility function complies with all five scenarios and saves them into a CSV file altogether.

## Setup
1. 5 Folders that contains submissions of each scenario that are of **CSV** format
2. The name of the CSV file ends up with the student number. At UWaterloo, student numbers are **8** digits.
3. DO NOT include column/row names in the submission.

## NOTE
Files with 929 in their name will likely be removed as there were the experimental units.

TODO
* [] Script to check whether the last 8 characters in the submission are digits
* [] Cleanup the files
* [] Automatic separate files into 5 subfolder. This can be done (easily) using regular expression.
* [] Fix the cleanup comment in each of the load scripts
